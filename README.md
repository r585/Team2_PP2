Project Log:

10/3/19 | Ryan Meyer | 1.5 hours | Created the github repository and added other team members as collaborators, so they can pull down files to edit. Began investigating changing 
KnightCode into a grammar file. Need to find a way to allow other team members to push correctly to the git repository.

10/3/19 | Elena Milan Lopez | 1.5 hours | Assisted with finding beginning steps to translate KnightCode to a grammar file. Found the correct way to copy the repository initially, then
we can push and pull any changes needed to git hub after this. Tested this method works correctly with github.

10/3/19 | Caleb Proffitt | 1.5 hours | Helped to understand the translation of KnightCode to a grammar file. Researched the correct way to be able to push and pull from the
team repository and discovered how branches can be incorporated into the project.
 
10/6/19 | Caleb Proffitt | 1.5 hours | Wrote initial drafts of the grammar file. Tested creating new branches in the project and using pull requests to merge the new branch into the master branch.

10/7/19 | Ryan Meyer | 1.0 hours | Pulled new files from GitHub. Helped to update the grammar file for the STRING components which allowed it to compile upon further bug testing.

10/7/19 | Caleb Proffitt | 1.0 hours | Pulled project onto the server for testing. Helped finalize the grammar file so that it can be compiled by antlr on the server.

10/17/19 | Ryan Meyer | 30 minutes | Made plan to finish the rest of the project. Determined the ANT file needs to be setup next.

10/17/19 | Caleb Proffitt | 30 minutes | Helped plan next steps for project. Going to meet up to work on the ANT file.
